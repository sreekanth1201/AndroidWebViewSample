To update url
 - Go MainActivity.kt file
 - Line 22 webView.loadUrl("https://www.opinionrewardspanel.com/en/signup?id=o7vlna4lqtpligb")
 - change URL required.
 
 Also, try to delete all your browser cache in emulator once you successfully load the url from any app (sample you created) then the url is successfully loading. Not the same case with Real Device. In Samsung s9 I can see it is always failing.
